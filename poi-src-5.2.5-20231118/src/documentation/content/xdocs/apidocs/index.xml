    <section><title>Apache POI Javadocs</title>
  <p>
   The Javadocs for the latest (development) version of Apache POI
   can be <a href="dev/index.html">accessed online here</a>, or build
   from a <a href="site:subversion">source code checkout</a>
   by running the <em>javadocs</em> Ant task. The
   <a href="dev/index.html">latest (development) Javadocs</a> are generally
   updated every few weeks, so may lag the most recent development slightly.
  </p>
  <p>
   For recent releases, the Javadocs for the latest stable release
   each the family can also be browsed online:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="ext:apidocs/v50">Apache POI 5.0.x Javadocs</a></li>
    <li><a href="ext:apidocs/v41">Apache POI 4.1.x Javadocs</a></li>
    <li><a href="ext:apidocs/v40">Apache POI 4.0.x Javadocs</a></li>
    <li><a href="ext:apidocs/v317">Apache POI 3.17 Javadocs</a></li>
  </ul>

  <section><title>Older Releases</title>
  <p>
    For every release of Apache POI, the specific Javadocs for that
    version are available with the release.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maven / Gradle / IDE users are able to fetch the javadocs for each
    of the Apache POI jars from Maven Central (or your preferred Maven
    mirror). These are made available with the <em>javadoc</em> classifier,
    e.g. <em>group: 'org.apache.poi', name: 'poi', version: '4.1.1',
           classifier: 'javadoc'</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have downloaded the <em>binary (bin)</em> release, then you
    can find the Javadocs within the download in the <em>/docs/apidocs/</em>
    folder.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have downloaded the <em>source (src)</em> release, then you
    need to build your own copy. Run the <em>javadocs</em> ant task
    to have the Javadocs built, the build will tell you the output
    directory at the end (it varies slightly between POI versions).
