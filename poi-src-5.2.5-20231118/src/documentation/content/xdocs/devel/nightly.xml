            <p>The POI nightly builds are run on the <a href="https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/POI/">Jenkins</a>
                continuous integration server.<br/>
                <strong>These builds should not be used in production</strong>: they are mostly intended for use by
                developers to help with resolving bugs and evaluating new features or users who want to try out the
                latest version.
