             ==============================
                Publishing POI Web Site
             ==============================

The Apache POI web site is https://poi.apache.org/

The HTML and other files for the web site are stored in svn at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/site
Committing files to the `publish` directory of this repo will automatically lead to the web site being updated.
There may be a small delay and you might need to force a refresh in your browser.

The site is built from using the main POI svn at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need an up to date version of Apache Ant installed (Ant 1.10 works well).
You also need to install Apache Forrest. Forrest is no longer maintained but PJ has a fork with a few small changes.
This is at https://github.com/pjfanning/apache-forrest-0.9

You can use the last official Apache Forrest release but you may notice some diffs when you build the site and try to
publish it. https://forrest.apache.org/

You will need to create an environment variable called FORREST_HOME and set it to match the directory location
where you installed Apache Forrest.

Building and Deploying the Site
-------------------------------

It is recommended that you open a command prompt and set up Java 8 as your default. The web site build will fail
if you use a very recent Java version.

In your local copy of the POI svn (https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk), run:

ant site

After this completes, you can copy the files in `build/site` to the `publish` directory in your poi-site checkout
(https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/site).

A command like this might work.

cp -r ~/svn/poi/build/site/* ~/svn/poi-site/publish/

I would recommend that you use `svn stat` and `svn diff` before committing the changes to poi-site.
