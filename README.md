# Examination Schedule Optimization

## Overview
Examination Schedule Optimization is a Java application designed to optimize the scheduling of exams for students in educational institutions. The application minimizes the number of days required for exams while ensuring that each student has only one exam per day and that no student has conflicting exams on the same day.

## Features
- Reads data from multiple Excel sheets containing student information, including name, roll number, and course IDs.
- Organizes student data into suitable data structures for processing.
- Utilizes an optimization algorithm to schedule exams, minimizing the number of days required.
- Ensures that each student has only one exam per day and resolves conflicts when multiple students have exams on the same day.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Add the Apache POI library to your project's dependencies.
4. Run the `ExamScheduler.java` file.
5. Provide the names of the Excel sheets containing student data as command-line arguments.
6. View the optimized exam schedule generated by the application.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache POI library (included in the `lib` directory or added as a dependency)
